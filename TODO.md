# Features
[ ] Image diff
[ ] Registry graph
[ ] Base swap
[ ] other config formats besides docker

[ ] we must limit the amount of requests that go out!!
    if we fetch all images/manifests than we make 1000+ requests
    the server does not like this

# Usability
[ ] good tui design with https://github.com/charmbracelet
